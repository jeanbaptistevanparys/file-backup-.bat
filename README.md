# file-backup-.bat
a simple batch file i made for my brother to easily upload his foto's to an external backup/server if u want to use it after the XCOPY add the path of the source (folder you want to backup) and a destination(place u want to store your files)
I automated this proces by making a task in the windows task scheduler when he plugs his external HDD in it automatically copies all the files
